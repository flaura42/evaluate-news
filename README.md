# evaluate-news
##4th Project for FEND

** Gain experience with: **
* Setting up Webpack
* Webpack Loaders and Plugins
* Creating Layouts and Page Design
* Service Workers
* Using APIs
* NLP

Unfortunately, due to Aylien no longer supporting the Text API, I had to use the News API and instead have changed the project to 'Fetch News'.

User enters a search topic and the API returns a list of 10 news articles on the topic.  I added date, source, and full article links to make it easier.

** To run this project: **
* Build development environment with `npm run build-dev`
* Build production environment with `npm run build-prod`
* Run tests with `npm test`
* Start the server with `npm start` and go to http://localhost:8080

** Made with the lovely help from: **
